# GRAB
Finding Time Series Natural Stuctures via A Novel Graph-Based Scheme

## Requirement
Matlab

## Quick Start
1. To run the GRAB approach, run `GRAB(A,SubsequenceLength,topN)`
2. To run the adapted FLUSS approach, run `FV(ts, SubsequenceLength, zone)`
3. To evaluate the clustering accuracy, run `computeClu(GT,community)`
4. To evaluate the segmentation error, run `computeSeg(GT,splitLoc)`
